# ft_fractol

This project involves creating fractals

## Introduction

Created by Benoît Mandelbrot in 1974 from the Latin root fractus, which means “broken”, or “irregular”.
A fractal figure is a mathematical object, such as a curve or a surface, whose structure is invariant
to any change in scale.

The aim of this project is to get to grips with the school's graphics library and
discover or use the mathematical notion of complex numbers, to tackle the problem of optimization
in graphics programming, and to manage events.


## Installing and Compiling ft_fractol

Clone the repository

```shell
https://github.com/guillaumeschwartz76/ft_fractol.git
```

You can go to the directory for compilation and can do ```make```.

## Executing ft_fractol

For executing the program, you must choose a specific fractol.
You can choose three different fractal: mandelbrot, julia <x> <y> or burnigship.

```shell
./fractol mandelbrot
```
```shell
./fractol julia 0.2 0.9
```
```shell
./fractol burnigship
```
